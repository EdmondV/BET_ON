  "faq13": "Why can’t I write anything in the chat window?",
  "faq13answer": "You can only chat in rooms where you’ve made a bet.",
  "faq14": "How does the betting work",
  "faq14answer": "When you enter the room, you can see the horizontal blue line splitting the game screen in two. This line indicates the entry point which has been set upon the room creation. You have to make a bet relative to this entry point. The Bulls win if the room closes with the price above the entry point, the Bears win if the room closes with the price below the entry point.",
  "faq15": "What is deadline",
  "faq15answer": "The vertical red line on the right is a deadline. It depicts the point at which players no longer can make bets. Note that every bet is moving deadline a little farther from the starting point.",

  "faq19answer": "This feature is to be implemented in the nearest future. Meanwhile you can share a link to your room with your friends by any other means.",
  "faq20": "What is WebGL",
  "faq20answer": "WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. In order to use Trading Rooms you need to enable WebGL in your browser’s preferences. Also make sure that your video driver is up to date.",
  "faq21": "Do you support mobile browsers",
  "faq21answer": "Due to the mobile screen size limitations and the absence of WebGL support, there is no mobile browsers optimization in plans.",
  "faq22": "Is there a mobile application available",
  "faq22answer": "The mobile app is in the works and should be arriving later this year.",
  "faq23": "How many rooms can I create at once",
  "faq23answer": "The room quantity you are able to create is virtually unlimited. However, you won’t be able to create any more rooms if your interface is filled up to the end. It depends on your screen resolution and size.",
  "faq24": "What is «Pin tab» and «Show bets»",
  "faq24answer": "The “Pin tab” checkbox allows you to pin current room at the top so you could easily find it while it’s active. It is checked by default. The “Show bets” checkbox is displaying all the bets in a particular room on the chart. You can uncheck it to see the chart more clearly.",
  "faq25": "What’s the difference between a demo player and a real one",
  "faq25answer": "Demo players can only play for virtual money. The real players can bet actual money and win real prizes.",
  "faq26": "Can demo player play with a real player",
  "faq26answer": "Demo and real servers are separate, thus it is impossible for a demo player to compete against a real one.",
  "faq27": "Which currency do you accept",
  "faq27answer": "Presently we are accepting USD only.",
  "faq28": "What are the numbers in the lower left corner",
  "faq28answer": "This is the current software version.",
  "faq29": "How is the payout calculated",
  "faq29answer": "The opposing team’s bets are forming a bank. The bank is then split evenly between the members of the winning team. If there are multiple bets from a single player, then every bet is handled as a separate player.",
  "faq30": "What if the room closes with the same price as it has been opened",
  "faq30answer": "Such an outcome will be considered as a draw. All the bets will be returned to the players with no commissions taken.",
